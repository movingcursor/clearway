# rebuild-local.sh — local-build counterpart to bump-image.sh.
#
# When `bump-image.sh` is the right tool: registry-pulled deployments where
# `amneziavpn/amneziawg-go:latest` exists for your platform. As of 2026-04
# the upstream image is amd64-only, so ARM hosts (this one) can't use it
# and instead build the image from source via /opt/docker/apps/amneziawg/.
# That's what this script automates.
#
# Flow:
#   1. docker build --no-cache amneziawg:local from the build context.
#   2. Read the new image's local Id (sha256). The image is never pushed,
#      so RepoDigests is empty — Id is the only stable handle.
#   3. Update the @sha256:... pin in clearway/awg-server/compose.yaml.
#   4. safe-restart.sh to pick up the new digest.
#   5. Verify with `amneziawg-go --version` + `awg --version` from the
#      running container.
#
# When to run:
#   - check.sh's weekly remote routine opens a GitHub issue
#     when amnezia-vpn/amneziawg-go or /amneziawg-tools master HEAD is
#     newer than the embedded baseline. Closing the issue means "rebuilt"
#     or "skipping this week"; closing it without rebuilding means the
#     next render of the issue (next week) will reopen if upstream advances.
#   - On security advisories (rare for AWG; the Amnezia team announces
#     via their TG channel, not via GitHub releases).
#
# Configuration:
#   BUILD_DIR     Where the Dockerfile lives. Defaults to /opt/docker/apps/amneziawg.
#   IMAGE_TAG     Tag for the built image. Defaults to amneziawg:local.
#   AWG_SERVER_DIR  Defaults to <script-dir>; holds compose.yaml + safe-restart.sh.
#   NOTIFY          Optional notification script (Discord webhook etc.).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  rebuild + restart succeeded (or no-op: image content unchanged).
#   1  build failed.
#   2  pin rewrite or restart failed.
#   3  pre-flight failed (compose.yaml unreadable, build context missing).
