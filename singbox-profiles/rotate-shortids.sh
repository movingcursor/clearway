#!/usr/bin/env bash
# rotate-shortids.sh — monthly Reality short_id rotation for every device.
#
# Why: the Reality short_id is a secondary auth factor alongside the per-
# device UUID. Rotating it periodically cuts the blast radius of any covert
# credential leak (a log line, a screenshot, a compromised client) to at
# most one rotation interval. Zero-downtime is free: render.py's 2h
# pending-rotation grace keeps the old short_ids live on the server, and
# clients refetch the manifest on a poll interval — any client that
# successfully polled before rotation picks up the new short_id before the
# grace window expires.
#
# Why not rotate UUIDs or passwords on the same schedule: those are the
# primary auth secret; rotating them is a more disruptive event (a client
# that hasn't polled in >2h *will* break) and should stay manual / admin-
# triggered. The short_id is cheap to rotate precisely because it's a
# secondary factor.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Edit .secrets.yaml in-place: replace every devices[].reality.short_id
#      with a fresh 16-hex-char token. One sed-grade regex pass, no YAML
#      parse/serialize round-trip (that would clobber the auto-managed-file
#      comments at the top).
#   2. Run `./render.py --server-apply -y`. This re-emits config.json with
#      the new short_ids, drops the old ones into .pending-rotations.yaml
#      with a 2h TTL, and safe-restarts singbox-server.
#   3. Notify on success AND failure (if NOTIFY is set) — success keeps
#      operators aware the cron actually fires (silent cron jobs rot).
#
# Not covered: Reality keypair rotation (that invalidates ALL clients
# atomically — no grace window possible since public_key is shared across
# users). See rotate-realitykey.sh for that.
