# check.sh — compare the running singbox-server's sing-box
# version against SagerNet/sing-box's latest GitHub release and report
# when a newer one exists. Mirrors awg-server/check.sh's shape.
#
# What it checks:
#   - The container's `sing-box version` output (semver, e.g. 1.13.10).
#   - The latest non-prerelease tag on github.com/SagerNet/sing-box.
#   - If `latest` > `current`, emit a bump report with the rebuild command.
#
# What it doesn't do: actually run the bump. That's bump-image.sh
# in this same directory, which pulls the new digest from ghcr, validates
# with `sing-box check` against the live config, and rewrites compose.yaml
# + safe-restarts. Auto-bumping defeats the digest-pin philosophy (see
# docs/architecture.md).
#
# Configuration:
#   SINGBOX_CONTAINER  Container name. Defaults to `singbox-server`.
#   NOTIFY             Optional notification script invoked with one arg
#                      (the report). Unset = print to stdout.
#   QUIET_OK           If set, suppress the "up to date" output (useful for
#                      cron). Newer-than-current always emits.
