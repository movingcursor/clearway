singbox-exporter — tiny Prometheus exporter for sing-box's clash_api.

Why: sing-box's clash_api exposes live connection + global byte totals, but
the data only lives there until somebody asks for it. Prometheus + Grafana
want a pull endpoint. This process proxies one call to clash_api per scrape
and returns a text-format metrics payload. No background state — every
scrape is independent — so restarts never drop counters (clash_api holds
the cumulative values for the life of the sing-box process).

Why on-demand and not a long-running poller:
  - simpler (no state, no race on shutdown)
  - clash_api's uploadTotal/downloadTotal ARE the cumulative source of
    truth; we just forward them as Prometheus counters
  - per-inbound live connection counts come from the same /connections
    response, so one HTTP call per scrape covers everything we expose

Per-user metrics are not directly derivable (clash_api connection metadata
carries the inbound tag but not the authenticated user). Per-source-IP
metrics ARE exposed as a practical stand-in — each household user's live
devices have a small number of stable source IPs, so "who's driving the
most traffic right now" is answerable via the singbox_live_connections_by_ip
and singbox_live_bytes_by_ip series. For a user→IP map, keep a static
label_values table in Grafana or Prometheus recording rules.

Deployment: host networking (so 127.0.0.1:9095 and 172.17.0.1:9097 are
both reachable from the same namespace). Secret is read from the
CLASH_SECRET env var at startup.

# is reachable from ANY container on ANY docker bridge (aio_network
# included) via host routing — a compromised container could read per-IP
# metrics with rDNS labels that reveal household users' residential/
# carrier IPs. Prometheus is the only legitimate scraper; a shared-secret
# gate is the minimum-blast-radius fix. /healthz stays unauthenticated so
# the docker healthcheck doesn't need the token.

# --- PTR (reverse-DNS) enrichment for the per-IP metrics ---
# Grafana's top-10-by-IP panels show raw numeric IPs by default, which gives
# no signal about whether an IP is a household user's residential/mobile
# carrier, a known scanner, a cloud VM, etc. Resolving the PTR once and
# emitting it as an extra label lets the dashboard render "92.184.117.188
# 92-184-117-188.mobile.fr.orangecustomers.net" — same UX as the Discord
# ban-notification rDNS added 2026-04-23.
#
# Design:
#   - Each scrape looks up PTRs only for the top-50 IPs we already emit.
#   - Results are cached in-process for PTR_TTL_S (1h default) — PTRs
#     for household + scanner IPs are very stable, and a stale PTR is
#     far less harmful than stalling the scrape.
#   - Lookups run in a bounded ThreadPoolExecutor (blocking gethostbyaddr
#     can take multi-second on timeout). We wait for at most PTR_WAIT_S
#     total per scrape; any lookup that hasn't returned by then emits
#     an empty PTR for this scrape and is retried next tick.
#   - RFC1918 + loopback source IPs (docker0 bridge, Traefik-fronted
#     connections) are skipped — they have no meaningful public PTR,
#     and reverse lookups on private IPs are slow timeouts waiting to
#     happen against resolvers that refuse them.
#   - Cache is soft-capped at 500 entries so a cardinality spike from
#     a scanner wave can't bloat the process indefinitely.
